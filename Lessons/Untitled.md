## Lesson 1: Containers

There is a container. Modify it.

Containers are the heart of ATML3. They allow you to get dynamic elements into your text. Your typical container looks like `[object_name;parameter,subparameter;parameter,subparameter;...]`


```python
# load rincewind training
```


```python
#load data (rincewind or myax)
```


```python
#render the training, expose only the line required for the sentence or property
```
